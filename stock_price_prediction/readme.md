### Stock price prediction
An implementation of several time-series forecasting methods (Exponential Smoothing, ARIMA and (G)ARCH models) in the context of stock price prediction

## Overview

- This repository contains several of the implementations of stock price prediction models for the MSc Business Analytics at the University of Edinburgh. 
- This project focused on forecasting the stock price of Dixons Carphone (FTSE: DC) for both the short (< 6 months) and long (1 > year) and exploring price driving factors for DC's stock price. 
- The R implementation is provided for the following predictive models
  - Exponential Smoothing models with various parameters and plotted predictions
  
- The implementations cover all the typical procedures required in time-series forecasting (unit-root testing, (differencing), check residuals for autocorrelation using the ACF and PACF plots)
